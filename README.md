📊 Website Performance Analysis

🔎 Data-Driven Insights for Digital Marketing and Web Optimisation

📁 Project Overview
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of website performance metrics using a dataset that includes information about traffic sources, user behaviour, and engagement over time.

As of 2025, there are estimated to be 110–120 crore websites globally, and over 60% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices. In such a competitive environment, understanding your website performance is crucial to digital success.

🧹Process Summary: 

1. Cleaned and prepared raw traffic data for analysis.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Visualized patterns and compared key engagement metrics across marketing channels.
4. Derived actionable insights for marketing and content teams.

📌 Key Objectives

I addressed the following key questions through data exploration and visual analysis:

1. Traffic Trends: What patterns can be observed in sessions and users over time?
2. Top Marketing Channel: Which channel brings the highest number of users to the website?
3. Engagement Analysis: Which channel has the highest average engagement time?
4. Engagement Rate by Channel: How does the engagement rate vary across different channels?
5. Engaged vs Non-Engaged: Which channels drive more engaged sessions, and how can underperformers improve?
6. Hourly Traffic Patterns: What are the peak hours for traffic from each channel?
7. Traffic vs Engagement Correlation: Is there a relationship between high traffic and engagement?
