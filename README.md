# 📊 WEBSITE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

## 🔎 DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS FOR DIGITAL MARKETING AND WEB OPTIMISATION

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of website performance metrics using a dataset that includes information about **traffic sources**, **user behaviour**, and **engagement over time**.

As of **2025**, there are estimated to be **110–120 crore websites globally**, and over **60% of web traffic** now comes from mobile devices. In such a competitive environment, understanding website performance is crucial to digital success.
